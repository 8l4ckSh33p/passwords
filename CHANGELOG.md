8.0.4
* Added German translation
* Completed Spanish translation
* Moved search field to navigation page, so this will stay visible when scrolling in a long list
* Mask passwords (click to view them). This is CSS-only for now, to prevent simple screenshot-theft of passwords. Will be JS-coded later, so passwords will actually load and be decrypted when '*****' is clicked
* Bug fixes (alignment of table heads, minor other things)

8.0.3
* Initial release, tested on ownCloud Server 8.0.*
