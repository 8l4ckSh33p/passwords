    <description>This is a Password Manager for viewing, editing and generating passwords. 
    
    	This app cannot be installed from within ownCloud, since this system demands repackaging of releases and kills the possibility to freely use GitHub master versions.

        You can insert and import your own passwords or randomly generate new ones. Some characters are excluded upon password generation for readability purposes (1, I, l and B, 8 and o, O, 0). Passwords are stored into the ownCloud database with combined EtM (Encrypt-then-MAC) and MCRYPT_BLOWFISH encryption (read Security part in Documentation for details). 

        Important: passwords can only be read (decrypted) by the user who created the password, on the ownCloud-instance where the password was created in (i.e. same password salt in config.php). If you lose the password salt, all passwords of all users are lost and unretrievable.

        Please read the documentation for more information about the generation of passwords and its security.
